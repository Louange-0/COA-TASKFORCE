using html css and javascript for hovering functions and other interactions.
In the CodingChallenges directory there are two files one is arraymanip.js whichchas a function that determines 
if there is a contiguous subarray within the array that sums the target and returns true if it exists and false if not.
The next file is stringmanip.js with a function that reverses a string if the string is divisible by 3,
replace characters of a string with ASCII code if string divisible by 5 and perform both operations if string divisible
by both 3 and 5.
